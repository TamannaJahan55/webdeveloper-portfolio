Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

State management refers to the process of managing the data or the state of a web application. It involves tracking changes to the data, and updating the UI (User Interface) accordingly. The main goal of state management is to ensure that the data displayed in the UI is consistent with the data in the application's state. There are different libraries and frameworks available for state management in web development, such as Redux and MobX for React, and Vuex for Vue.js
